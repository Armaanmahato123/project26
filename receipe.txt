1. First rinse and then quarter about 200 grams of brinjal or eggplant (7 to 8 medium sized eggplants). Immerse the brinjal pieces in salt water. This method removes bitterness from brinjal if any and prevents their discoloration.
2. Next, add 2 tablespoons of white sesame seeds and 3 tablespoons of peanuts to a grinder/blender or spice-grinder.
3. Then add 6 tablespoons of desiccated coconut, ½ teaspoon coriander seeds and ½ teaspoon cumin seeds as well.
4. Now grind the mixture to a fine texture and set aside.
5. Next heat 3 tablespoons of oil in a heavy pan or kadai or skillet. Then add ⅓ cup of chopped onions. Use any neutral oil or sunflower or peanut oil.
6. Stir and then begin to sauté the onions on medium-heat.
7. Continue to stir often and sauté the onions until they turn light golden.
8. Now add 2 teaspoons of ginger-garlic paste to the brinjal curry mixture. For the paste, you can crush 1 inch of ginger and 5-6 medium-sized garlic cloves in a mortar-pestle.
9. Mix and sauté for a few seconds, until the raw aroma of both the ginger and garlic goes away.
10. Now reduce to low heat and add the ground sesame seeds, peanut and coconut mixture.
